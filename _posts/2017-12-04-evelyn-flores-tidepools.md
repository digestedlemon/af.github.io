<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;"><em>Evelyn Flores writes from the island of Guahån/Guam in the Western Pacific. Her research and creative activities are dedicated to preserving and publishing the stories of the Indigenous CHamoru of her island particularly but also of the broader geographic area of Micronesia. She is one of two editors of An Anthology of Indigenous Literatures from Micronesia, published by University of Hawai‘i Press to be released September 2018. As problems with rising sea levels increase and as the militarization of Guam intensifies, her attention as a scholar and writer has turned to how literature can insert itself to make a difference in the discussions and the outcomes. Evelyn is an associate professor of English at the University of Guahån/Guam where she specializes in Pacific Island, Indigenous, and late 19th-century American Literatures.</em></span>
