<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Bunched up for ardour, all the eels</span>  
 <span style="font-size: 12pt;">leave the crush hall standing for</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">the great cartels of the plain. Eel</span>  
 <span style="font-size: 12pt;">is on a fresh course with its own</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">submission forms and target. Eel</span>  
 <span style="font-size: 12pt;">sung-through, but as distinctive in</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">its mating and feasting gestures as</span>  
 <span style="font-size: 12pt;">a journey out and back. Eel as one</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">of the speaking courtesans; eel as</span>  
 <span style="font-size: 12pt;">sweet as an absence panel when</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">the water rushes the past around</span>  
 <span style="font-size: 12pt;">it then runs straight into the past</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">like a pistol-whip. By this point</span>  
 <span style="font-size: 12pt;">the eel is understood to be our</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">nerve-endings. Tough old wings</span>  
 <span style="font-size: 12pt;">stuffed with eel, stuffed in turn in</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">an overstated take on livery and</span>  
 <span style="font-size: 12pt;">breathing in hard red lines. Under</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">the radar, I will be mandated to</span>  
 <span style="font-size: 12pt;">say the oil paid for its own transit:</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">without it the eel was running and</span>  
 <span style="font-size: 12pt;">running but wouldn’t have got us</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">to the turnpike. An eel has its eye</span>  
 <span style="font-size: 12pt;">of you, opens on to a clean window,</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">and scans for the heat off you in the</span>  
 <span style="font-size: 12pt;">jumping fountain, in the tenement</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">halls it’s still the pigeons’ job to hit.</span>
