<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">In the summer</span>  
<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">we walked through the forest</span>  
<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">then past</span>  
<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">dwarf weeping willows</span>  
<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">coming out of cracked land</span>  
<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">by the Siret river</span>  
<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">and washed the wool</span>  
<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">we carried in <em>coșărci</em><sup>1</sup></span>  
<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">in the hasty stream.</span>

<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;"><sup>1</sup> wicker baskets</span>

<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;"><em>Anastasia Cojocaru is a recent graduate of The University of Aberdeen in English and International Relations. She is currently pursuing a master’s degree in Environmental Policy at Sciences Po Paris. She is a queer woman of Romanian heritage. Her poetry and prose are inspired by her memories growing up in post-communist Romania, the time she spent abroad, and Romanian superstitions, myths & folklore. She writes about moments that she has been affected by in a way that helps her process and understand what she feels. She also loves practising yoga, cycling, and going to tango classes.</em></span>
