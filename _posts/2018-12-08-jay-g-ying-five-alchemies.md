# <span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">Five Alchemies</span>

<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">I do not recognise them in the mist, my box of earth</span>  
<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">in pieces. Around the freshwater fish flank those words</span>

<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">of fever printed on newspaper leaves like a recipe</span>  
<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">for immortality. Bygone fins, finished bylines, five days</span>

<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">past I dreamt our park was as red as cinnabar: headshot</span>  
<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">of a politician in the distanced casing. This is bliss:</span>

<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">as the slime left the beast’s mouth so life returned</span>  
<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">to our orphan’s lake. Photograph of a suit dissolves</span>

<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">into our riverbank, some deal of life on the side; scandal</span>  
<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">appearing past the gold flash of water on the shores;</span>

<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">hands that pan out the black elemental roe. Flesh</span>  
<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">transmuted as I descaled my catch at home; it was like</span>

<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">peeling a warm pink flake of paper from a printer.</span>  
<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;"><em>Earth, wood, water, metal, fire.</em> My kitchen dulled as</span>

<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">the pin eye of the fish in the stew grew softer with</span>  
<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">the steam. I took the scalloped blade past me way into</span>

<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">the evening. The last cruise liner had devoured those</span>  
<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">fake stalls of cheap lacquer, and from what was not</span>

<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">broken over, the news leaked out slowly weeping</span>  
<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">like sap. I found what I had been all along suspecting.</span>

<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">We moved into a new cycle: another man replaced.</span>  
<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">I filled my bath with mercury bubbling to its brim.</span>
