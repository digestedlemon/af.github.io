# <span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">April in Oman</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">It must be hot in Oman by now,</span>  
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">the sky scalding blue, cars ovens at</span>  
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">noon, and molten seas of glass.</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">But the bougainvillea are still blazing and the gulmohurs too. The sea soup boils</span>  
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">on the sand but for a while</span>  
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">for the sun will soon vanish and the moon fatly bloom in the sky.</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">The neem tree outside my houses, whose roots rumple the concrete, its flower-breath will stubbornly<br /> perfume the air,</span>  
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">like mysteries emerging from</span>  
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">cool caves of rocks</span>  
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">where they were asleep the entire day,</span>  
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">to play with the stars and thumb-small croaking frogs and the fugitive bat, which</span>  
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">parabolas through the early a.m. cool,</span>  
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">fleeing from the mauve desert beyond.</span>
