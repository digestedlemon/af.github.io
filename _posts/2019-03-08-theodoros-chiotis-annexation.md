# <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">annexation</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Having not given up on <del>my</del> mother tongue, <del>I</del> have found <del>my</del>self buying more dictionaries than <del>I</del> can actually afford. A tentative act of connection, a passing of cutlery, the uneven breaking of bread, an ongoing process of annexation.</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">In folk tales, the protagonist (usually a man) often needs to learn and use someone else’s secret language in order to survive some deathly threat (such as the Sphinx). Signal and noise in perfect balance. The goal of perpetuation and dissemination. Yet, transparency in language is a false idea. Questions of language and semantics always emerge between <del>my</del>self and <del>my</del> lover who was brought up speaking this other language which has colonised <del>my</del> thoughts. <del>I</del> am more abstract in <del>my</del> thinking but this other language makes <del>me</del> write more compact, more clipped sentences in <del>my</del> mother tongue. <del>I</del> now find that the surfaces of doors and hatches smell of smoked peaches. An unexpected series of additions to the vocabulary.</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">This embezzlement of both dead and living languages and dialects only obfuscates the initial desire. Can <del>we</del> talk about the origin of this desire? How are dictionaries compiled? In the Superman comic books, Superman often finds himself in the reverse world of Bizzarro where language means the reverse of what it signals. Signal is indistinguishable from noise. After the anaesthesia has worn off, one touches the newly marked areas of skin until <del>they</del> feel normal. The goal of perpetuation.</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;"><del>We</del> rehabilitate our imaginations through languages that are not <del>ours</del>. <del>I</del> rehabilitate myself in these other languages though <del>I</del> am secretly relieved that this other language has not yet fully invaded <del>my</del> dreams. The irruption has been avoided thus far though my sleep is invaded by the demands of paid work occurring in this other language. So, the/<del>my</del> body becomes the/a site where writing, speaking and thinking in this/another language occurs and extends out into the world. Yet the/a body is the/a sky map enveloped by the/a skin of language gradually but never fully revealing itself.</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Writing a poem in a language other than what might be considered to be <del>your</del> native one raises not just issues and questions of authenticity but also draws out the magpies. The goal of dissemination.</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">To return to an earlier point: dictionaries function both as mirror tests as well as mechanisms of agency. A site of alleged regeneration is also a site of lesions and severance. Even if <del>I</del> were to put together a collection called “Using the Right Hand” but <del>I</del> can never tell which hand is the correct one. How can solidarity be expressed in a language that is not considered to be <del>my</del> own? The foreground of an image might be faked but the noise inherent in the image cannot. There is more than one way to use language but <del>I</del> have been taught of specific ways to arrive at specific uses of language. <del>I</del> thought <del>I</del> was stealing pebbles from a beach that belonged to others but now <del>I</del> find <del>my</del> mouth filled with sand and flies dripping from the tips of <del>my</del> fingers.</span>
