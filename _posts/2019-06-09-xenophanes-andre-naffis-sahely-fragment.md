# <span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">Fragment</span>

<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">When a stranger appears in wintertime,</span>  
<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">these are the questions you must ask,</span>  
<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">as you lie reclined on soft couches,</span>  
<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">eating nuts, drinking wine by the fire:</span>  
<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">“What&#8217;s your name?”, “Where do you come from?”,</span>  
<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">“How old were you when the Persians invaded?”</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;"><em>Xenophanes (c. 570—c. 475 B.C.E.) was a Greek philosopher and poet.</em></span>

<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;"><em>André Naffis-Sahely is the author of The Promised Land: Poems from Itinerant Life (Penguin, 2017). His first poetry pamphlet, The Other Side of Nowhere, has just been published by Rough Trade Books. His translations include twenty titles of fiction, poetry and nonfiction, featuring works by Honoré de Balzac, Émile Zola, Abdellatif Laâbi, Tahar Ben Jelloun and Alessandro Spina. Several have been featured as &#8216;Books of the Year&#8217; in The Guardian, Literary Hub and NPR.</em></span>
