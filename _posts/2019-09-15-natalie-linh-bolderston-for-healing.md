# <span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">For Healing</span>

<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;"><em>For joint pain</em></span>

<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">Grind up a single ginger root. Mix well with a tablespoon of salt</span>  
<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">and water heated to 50 degrees Celsius. Stand in it every morning,</span>  
<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;"><em>to drain weakness from the body</em>. Coax your blood to release you</span>  
<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">from your chemical inheritances. Forget that every woman</span>  
<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">in your family has learned to pray on burning knees.</span>  
<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">Between every bone, there is an erosion:</span>  
<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">a gap filled with stories from your youth.</span>  
<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">How delicate your hands the first time you tweezed glass</span>  
<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">from a wound, gave stitches, washed a cadaver.</span>  
<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">Now, your fingers are swollen with the energy of mourning,</span>  
<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">last words gathered under your nails. Let flickers of heat</span>  
<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">salvage each of your body&#8217;s frozen bridges.</span>  
<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">Lie back with your hands at your sides,</span>  
<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">for once unobliged to make something live.</span>

<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;"><em>For flu</em></span>

<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">Boil lemongrass in your largest saucepan and cover tightly.</span>  
<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">Undress in the dark. Cover your body with two blankets</span>  
<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">and lie beside the pot. Open the lid slowly; let the steam hit</span>  
<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">your face. Inhale and <em>sweat the poison out</em>.</span>  
<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">After, your mother will rub spoons on your back</span>  
<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">with Eagle brand oil <em>to banish bad wind</em>,</span>  
<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">scrape every pore until it sings.</span>  
<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">She will leave purple moons that fade</span>  
<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">each time someone survives. As a child,</span>  
<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">I saw the marks on my mother&#8217;s back</span>  
<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">and demanded to know who had done this. She explained</span>  
<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">that it was an old cure her grandmother had taught her,</span>  
<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">that it worked just as well as it did back home,</span>  
<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">that an act of love will remain the same.</span>

<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;"><em>For fever</em></span>

<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">Steep one teaspoon of dried qing hao in warm water.</span>  
<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">Drink three times a day <em>to purge internal heat</em>.</span>  
<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">Once, my mother translated for a TB patient with no English,</span>  
<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">told him that his cells had to start again.</span>  
<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">She took note of the volume of blood rising up his throat –</span>  
<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">his insides unable to hold their own mutiny. Before diagnosis,</span>  
<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">he&#8217;d gone outside to smoke. That morning, broken webs</span>  
<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">had gauzed the air, and he&#8217;d puffed into a winter</span>  
<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">that made him ask <em>are all the trees in England dead?</em></span>  
<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">while his lungs formed black forests.</span>  
<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">He swallowed his pills with bitter tea sent by relatives,</span>  
<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">and swore he could feel the herbs taking root</span>  
<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">inside him. He wondered if his ancestors had died</span>  
<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">with their chests full of yellow flowers.</span>
