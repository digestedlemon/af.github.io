# <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">ghosts illuminate</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">what a finite system dabs with repertoire. The earliest record of an illuminated manuscript was in the first millennium. These are also called gospel books. I imagine a traveler carrying a book into an unknown town. Say the book is an animal relic brought by another animal into a city. Paper was rare and usually made of parchment sheets derived from the skins of animals. Ghosts watch patrons shell out currency as more animals are hunted to make paper. As though bodies are replaceable as purchase. The first and most popular colour used was gold, which is reminiscent of kintsugi, a practice of the Japanese. There are at least three names for each different tincture used in the manuscripts. Ghosts witness colour drawn out of acid from the bodies of insects mixed with aluminum salt to produce dye. Imagine light as an exchange made out of every death. Ghosts revel in water and exhale a talisman of colour. Here the water is blue, inscribed as the inside of a medieval era manuscript. Spring wants nothing of you but memory. Ghosts gather in the hallway of flowers. Butterflies flutter over flowers. Fields stand in stoic silences like illuminated manuscripts, recounting the same story. One part often discussed at the end is how each manuscript was a token, or substitute of reading for illiterate members of society. I dream a painting where ghosts walk into a heliotrope garden in summer, and the canvas extends into winter, an image in which ghosts carry heliotropes into their hearts. Praise the skin, solvent into reliquaries of gold. The last song between a knell and harness, the fulguration.</span>

# <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">ghosts with elegies of muscle</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">ghosts freckle silence</span>  
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; into an obsidian stone</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">earth moves into small tissues</span>  
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in its seas & ruffles bones</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">deep in the seabed sediment.</span>  
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ghosts with skulls full</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">of winged beetle glow</span>  
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; at sundowning.</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">a wren resting in a swath</span>  
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in damp after-rain air.</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">ghosts appear in syncopated</span>  
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; refrains & realign sounds.</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">move the pastoral into a soft</span>  
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; muscle where ghosts eschew</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">the body & reformulate it as</span>  
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a prehistoric sea of aquamarine.</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">ghosts breathe through coral reefs</span>  
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; each polyps a cluster of prayers</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">built from larvae & migration.</span>  
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ghosts reside in this silence</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">warming spaces with undercurrents</span>  
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; under the abyss of water skin.</span>
