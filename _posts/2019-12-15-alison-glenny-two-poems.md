# <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Pulse</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Each drawer contained a bird. When she turned the key she<br /> discovered the rows of tiny cloaks. ‘I had wanted to describe<br /> each bone and feather. But I was distracted by the silence of<br /> the forest, its resemblance to a sky in which the brightest<br /> stars are missing or faint.’ She tried to coax the clockwork<br /> bird into song by oiling its voice box, but when she set the<br /> gears in motion the silver throat had no pulse.</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;"><sup>1</sup> If tables could be made to talk, then why not sofas and candelabras? Chandeliers multiplied, eclipsing starlight. A passion for music boxes in every room.</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;"><sup>2</sup> If only the long, curved beaks of the females had not resembled ivory, sparking an immoderate desire for brooches, adorned with tiny chains. The last pair of laughing owls were sent as a gift to a collector, and vanished in the darkness of the museum.</span>

# <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Notes for a History of Birdsong</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;"><sup>1</sup> The poem, which documents the appearance of a flock of starlings from inside a snowstorm, is regarded as a symbol of the poet’s desire to be emulated.</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;"><sup>2</sup> The use of pins and a cylinder to impersonate a bird call was an aspect of Freemasonry. Initially concealed within cuckoo clocks or other timepieces, by 1820 the intricate mechanism was visible to the audience, displayed under glass in increasingly ornate cases.</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;"><sup>3</sup> While the influence of clouds on romanticism is well-known, less attention has been paid to ornithology. The significance of ‘hovering’ for example, or a belief in the immortality of the song. Reproduced by way of perforated rolls or folded books, in the end it hardly mattered whether the poet was awake or sleeping.</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;"><sup>4</sup> Derived from the word for ‘finch’. Versions of this instrument include the <em>merline</em>, pitched to the vocal range of blackbirds, and the <em>turtelaine</em>, which imitated a curlew.</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;"><sup>5</sup> While their wings enabled them to rise above the material signifier, critics note that for the sake of the lyric the bird itself must remain dark or unseen. Also that by the end of the poem, the actual bird has been replaced by a symbol.</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;"><sup>6</sup> The identification of women with caged birds is a cliché of eighteenth-century art. A confusion over the meaning of ‘captivation’ has been blamed for their obsession with hunting. For a complementary discussion of whether or not the bird can ever escape the cage of representation, see Appendix 1.</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;"><sup>7</sup> The location of the syrinx where the trachea forks into the lungs gave rise to the misleading belief that the bird sang from its heart.</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;"><sup>8</sup> A reference to Mozart’s starling. While the song is reputed to have been the inspiration for the sestina, one should never discount the influence of troubadour poetry on the diction of the envoi.</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;"><br /> &nbsp;<br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;"><em>Alison Glenny is a Pākeha (non-indigenous), queer writer from Aotearoa/New Zealand.
