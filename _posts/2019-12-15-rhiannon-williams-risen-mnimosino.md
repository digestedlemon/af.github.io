# <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Risen / Mnimosino</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Is it worth it, this August, to get up and go again?</span>  
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">The women’s shoulders have turned to smooth brown pebbles,</span>  
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">but this is St. Lazarus’ church and you must cover them up</span>  
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">or suffer the stare of your neighbour, shot along the worn-wood horizon.</span>  
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Warping a thin, dark yellow candle, breathing in the animal smell</span>  
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">of its origins and trying to will some significance into this service,</span>  
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">I’m waiting for the priest to say my grandmother’s name –</span>  
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">I always miss it, his fast chant cheats me and keeps her where the dead belong.</span>  
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">In the afternoon, my uncles play cards while the women stand wrist-deep in offal.</span>  
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">They strip and drain clammy poultry, gouge out tough little hearts of vermillion,</span>  
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">ropy red webbing to peel and divide from the breasts and the thighs.</span>  
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">They roll up their sleeves and deliver. My mother eats the heart and liver.</span>  
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">The men take their coffee <em>sketo</em>, black-pudding-dark.</span>  
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">I take through a tray of tiny white cups and saucers</span>  
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">ceremonial under eyes sliding up from hearts and spades.</span>  
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">I hope they remember how she fed them; some of them she raised.</span>  
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">It seems to me sometimes that the service comes too late.</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">We were told not to enter the church while menstrual.</span>  
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">I did as my grandmother would have, and showed up.</span>  
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">She said a slap would shock blood flow to a stop.</span>  
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">She drank them under the table, and poured enough for everybody,</span>  
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">she tore up all the red roses in her garden, because it made me laugh.</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;"></span>  
&nbsp;  
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Note: mnimosino / μνημόσυνο – the anniversary of a death in Greek Orthodox culture.</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;"><em>Rhiannon Williams is an English-Cypriot poet, researcher, writer and a co-founder of Feminist Internet. She has written and spoken publicly about the division and buffer zone of the island of Cyprus, and how our surroundings both natural and man-made impact our empathy and our communal relationships. She is also interested in gender, nature and liminal spaces. Her debut poetry pamphlet, Saturnine/Saturnalia, was published in 2018.</em></span>
