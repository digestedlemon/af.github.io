<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;"><em>Salomé Honório (aka Daniel Lourenço) is an enby poet and researcher commited to poetic kink, communal ethos, hearty geekiness and abolitionist horizons. Trained in literary and queer studies; still scoping other modes of knowing, feeling, and playing forwards. Born and based in the vicinity of Lisbon, Portugal. Their works include the book &#8216;Lábio/Abril&#8217; (Portugal, Editora Traveller) and the poetic pamphlet &#8216;fox, closet & fist&#8217; (UK, wynter olympics). A new UK-based bilingual publication is currently in the works.</em></span>
