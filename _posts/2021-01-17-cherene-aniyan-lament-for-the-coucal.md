# <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Lament for the Coucal</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Looking out the window so long, I have forgotten<br /> how to say my name. In the garden, a coucal hops<br /> Mother calls it a good omen and sneezes twice.</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Inviting luck in, I remove my lungs to make room<br /> for her. Cayenne pepper eye aims for me, then<br /> takes flight, remnant of blue string still tied to left foot.<br /> Five years since I last slept, now I keep watch<br /> at the town square reading palms and psalms.</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">How far down how long a rope should someone be<br /> to tie good luck to a tree? Shops have put up<br /> funeral tents, workers have gone home<br /> sans lung sans luck, they go back to wheat<br /> fields they sprouted from. Cameras found Tyche<br /> stealing in at twilight to free her crimson pheasant.</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Downpour plagued the town for a fortnight,<br /> bird nowhere to be seen. Townsfolk gather with make<br /> shift drums to bring her back, mother weeps<br /> at their superstition. I dream of eyes dropping<br /> from heaven, manjadi seeds falling like hail. A thousand<br /> blinded coucals in flight, flapping terrified like choking men<br /> descend on treetops, crash into clothing lines, plunge<br /> into wells, ride bicycles blind, steal cars, steer<br /> trains, the earth thick with luck, leaving neither room<br /> nor air for collapsing lungs.</span>
