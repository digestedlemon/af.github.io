# <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">my lover and the tree</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">my lover tried to put the trunk<br /> or bough of a large tree<br /> into the north sea.</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">this tree, bewilded, caked<br /> with mining waste and oxidized<br /> wacke pebbles faced</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">these waves with a bristling<br /> candor, a take-me-or-not<br /> glare into the whistling wind;</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">and beau, mired<br /> in the trebles of this riotous<br /> beach, a cackle and screech—</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">what ardor!—stuck<br /> his feet into the thing;<br /> past cobble and kelp-vine,</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">until it settled in the crook<br /> of the sea’s lazing back—<br /> and hear the waves’ din:</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">the tide’s coming in!</span>

# <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">nuclear</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I stretched skin<br /> of guava<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; across my mouth</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; captured<br /> specks<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; granite</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; mountain ion<br /> blood yellow<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; gum swell electron</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; bullet</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">undetonated</span>
