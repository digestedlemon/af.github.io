# <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">for reasons</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">The voices in our heads have<br /> given up forgiving<br /> these cracked pots<br /> lugging them around. Still,<br /> there are alley cats<br /> to croon to, warm<br /> showers and wildflowers<br /> outcompeting pavement. There<br /> is a life I wish to<br /> follow. Outside<br /> some brown bird is singing<br /> its fool heart out, and<br /> I want its name to fall<br /> from my mouth.</span>
