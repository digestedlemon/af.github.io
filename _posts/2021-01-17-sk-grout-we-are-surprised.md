<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/ when it takes our abridged version of events and floods the train station, breaks over several ancient sea walls, logjams the cross bridge, cakes sand into carpet / does fault lie in uniformity / spare cables, knotted netting, twisting shadows like kelp / the ocean’s words are multiple, garbled, direct – but we still have not mastered translation of movement / we’re still listening to audio files of the sea’s cadence repackaged as entertainment and sinning / two point five billion coffee cups per annum / we argue over the verb choice and where the punctuation goes / we talk at length about how hard is that process / one truck load of plastic every minute / we amuse ourselves finding complicated, Greek-origin words for the test / un-opened, unused bottles of bleach / the myths reshape a mother birthing serpents, so we write essays on her fault / who are we to judge a serpent’s worth? / rusted knives, but no less dull / instead, we focus on insurance money / a plastic ring takes the life of several seagulls, an otter, a family of tuna / repeated the next day, and the next day, and the next day / and we are surprised when the ocean returns the things we throw away</span>
